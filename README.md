# A-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Detecting-COVID-19-from-X-ray-image
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on both the world economy and the health of people everywhere. More than 5 million people have been confirmed to be infected with the virus as of May 24th, 2020, and more 
than 300,000 people have passed away globally. More than 6500 people have been infected and more than 300 have died in Finland as a result of COVID-19. 
Increasing the testing capacity is one efficient way to fight COVID-19. However, due to a lack of testing kits in some locations, such as Bangladesh, this is not 
feasible. This thesis develops a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to detect COVID-19 using only chest X-Ray images, driven by the open-source
community's efforts to collect the COVID-19 dataset and the success of Deep Learning on prior studies with chest radiography.
This work is aimed towards developing/facilitating technologies that the community can use to help the agricultural community of Bangladesh.
